#  IPL Data Analysis

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and deriving insights from the 'Indian Premier League (IPL)' dataset.  
The analysis involves player statistics, team performances, and match outcomes, presented with clear visualizations for better understanding.

---

##  Project Overview
The objective of this project is to:
- Clean and preprocess the IPL dataset.
- Perform in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize key trends in batting, bowling, and team performance.
- Identify top players and teams across different seasons.
- Derive actionable cricket insights.

---

##  Dataset
The dataset contains match-level and ball-by-ball details from IPL seasons.  
It includes:
- Match details (teams, city, toss decision, winner, etc.)
- Player-level performance (runs, wickets, strike rate, economy, etc.)
- Season-wise distribution of matches.

##  Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** → Data manipulation & cleaning  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** → Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → Interactive analysis

##  Key Analysis Performed
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature extraction (e.g., season, city-wise grouping)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Matches per season
   - Top 5 batsmen and bowlers per season
   - City-wise and venue-based match distribution
   - Toss decisions and win probabilities

3. **Visualizations**
   - Bar plots, line charts, and heatmaps
   - Distribution of runs per ball
   - Top-performing players and teams  

---

##  Insights
- Mumbai and Bangalore have hosted the most number of matches.  
- Certain teams show a higher probability of winning after winning the toss.  
- Top batsmen and bowlers vary across seasons, showing changing dominance.  
- Strike rates and economy rates play a significant role in match outcomes.
